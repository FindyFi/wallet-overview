# Overview of SSI Wallets and their Characteristics

Here we maintain our overview for SSI wallets. The information is aggregated from input from wallet vendors (via a [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdM1h1n-LtbaB5ug8YEnT7pfa__2Y4ehhNobdsPdNMA63c4YQ/viewform?usp=sf_link?hl=en)) and our [IIW/RWOT work on credential profiles](https://github.com/vcstuff/credential-profile-comparison).

## Goal 
The overview serves the following purposes:
- Issuers, verifiers and holders can use it to make a choice in wallet, based on their preferred characteristics.
- It offers insight in which wallets are interoperable with each other.
- It allows us to prioritise for which wallet a connector to our [TNO EASSI gateway](https://eassi.ssi-lab.nl/) should be developed.

## How to contribute
