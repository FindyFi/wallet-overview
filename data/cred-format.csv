Glossary,Which/How many useful software libraries available?,What is the policy regarding intellectual properties associated with this technology? ,Where is the credential format specified?,Under which Standardization Body and which standards track/status is the credential format standardized?,According to NASA-Scheme (http://www.artemisinnovation.com/images/TRL_White_Paper_2004-Edited.pdf),Data encoding on the storage layer which applies to this credential format ,Is the credential format able to communicate data or annotations that supports the semantic understanding of the credential data?,"Is the credential format capable to cover different cryptographic algorithms and achieve cryptographic agility, as demanded by regulations?",Is the credential format capable of selective disclosure - presenting or revealing a subset of claims/attributes - without relying on architecture and protocol solutions like Just-in-Time issuance or a presentation transformation by a trusted third party?,"Is the credential Format able to produce general-purpose predicates, that means attestations without revealing the data, e.g. age over 18?",What signing algorithms can the format be combined with?,What key management methods can the credential format be combined with?
