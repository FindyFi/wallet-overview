Glossary,How complex is the implementation? Which/How many useful software libraries available?,What is the policy regarding intellectual properties associated with this technology? ,Where is the signature algorithm specified?,Under which Standardization Body and which standards track/status is the signing algorithm standardized?,According to NASA-Scheme (http://www.artemisinnovation.com/images/TRL_White_Paper_2004-Edited.pdf),Is the signing algorithm recognized in regulatory frameworks of leading government bodies?,How performant is the signing algorithm?,"Is the Signing Algorithm supported by common hardware-backed cryptographic implementations, such as Secure Elements, SecureEnclave, HSM, Strongbox, TEE, TPM","Is the Signing Algorithm capable of creating a credential scheme, such that two verification processes can not be linked/correlated by colluding Verifiers/Relying Parties",What level of security strength is common and standardized for this signing algorithm?,Is the Signing Algorithm still secure if quantum computing achieves substantial computation power?
